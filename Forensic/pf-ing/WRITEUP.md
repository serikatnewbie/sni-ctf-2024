If you analyze it with pslist or pstree, you wont notice anything suspicious

Because of that, try to check the prefetch artifacts that residen in the memory dumo

coba analisa file2 prefetch tersebut dan ingat bahwa proses microsoft edge adalah msedge.exe bukan Edge.exe
Analyze the prefetch files. You will notice there is Edge.exe proccess that suspicious. (Remember that the process of MS Edge is msedge.exe, not Edge.exe)

Ketika parsing prefetch Edge.exe dengan PECmd
Analyze the Edge.exe prefetch with PECmd and you will find out that this exe will load some files in the Documents folder, resulting .dll files in `%localappdata%/temp` which is suspicious

By that evidence, you can assume that the Edge.exe is the malicious program and the data might be encrypted in the temp folder.
Proceed to decrypt by dump the Edge.exe and the encrypted files

Key is being randomized but only in the range of % 256 which can be bruteforced
