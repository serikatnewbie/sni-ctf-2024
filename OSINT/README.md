# OSINT Challenges

An OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) is a type of cybersecurity puzzle that tests your ability to gather and analyze publicly available information to solve a specific problem or uncover hidden data. OSINT involves using freely accessible sources, such as social media, forums, websites, databases, and online tools, to collect data about a target.
